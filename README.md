   # CLI Agent
   This repository contains a command-line AI agent (agi) built with TypeScript and powered by the lmnr
   framework and the AI/OpenAI SDKs. The project provides a CLI entrypoint, evaluation scripts, and
   examples for using shell/file tools and multi-turn agents.

   ---
   ## Quick overview
   - Project name: agi
   - CLI binary (after build): `dist/cli.js` (exposed as the `agi` bin in package.json)
   - Primary source: `src/` (TypeScript)
   - Built output: `dist/`
   - Evaluations and tests: `evals/`

   ---
   ## Directory structure
   Top-level files and folders you will commonly use:
   - .claude/                - (project-specific metadata/config for Claude integrations, if any)
   - .env                    - environment variables (API keys). DO NOT commit this file. Create your own
    `.env` locally.
   - .gitignore              - files and patterns ignored by git (includes `.env` and `dist/`)
   - AGENTS.md               - documentation / configuration for agents shipped with the repo
   - CLAUDE.md               - notes or configuration related to Claude usage
   - biome.json              - developer/tooling config (biome formatter/runner)
   - course.yaml             - optional course/config data used by the project
   - dist/                   - compiled JavaScript output (generated by `npm run build`)
   - evals/                  - evaluation scripts (multi-turn, file-tools, shell-tools, etc.)
   - node_modules/           - installed npm dependencies
   - notes/                  - project notes and scratch files
   - openspec/               - open API specs or similar artifacts
   - package.json            - npm package metadata and scripts (see "Scripts" below)
   - package-lock.json       - npm lock file
   - src/                    - TypeScript source code (entrypoint is `src/index.ts`)
   - tsconfig.build.json     - TypeScript build configuration used for `npm run build`
   - tsconfig.json           - TypeScript config

   If you need a specific file's purpose, check that file; the repo already includes `AGENTS.md` and
   `CLAUDE.md` which explain agent-specific config and usage in greater detail.

   ## What the agent can do
   This repository implements a CLI AI agent scaffold which typically supports the following capabilities
    (actual capabilities depend on the code in `src/` and available tool registrations):
   - Run as a CLI application (development mode or built JS in `dist/`).
   - Use language models via `@ai-sdk/openai`, `ai`, and the `@lmnr-ai/lmnr` framework.
   - Execute shell commands and interact with the filesystem via tools (dependencies include `shelljs`).

   - Run automated evaluations contained in `evals/` (examples for multi-turn conversations, file-tools,
   and shell-tools exist).
   - Be extended with additional tools, agents, and evaluation scripts by modifying `src/` and `evals/`.

   Note: The exact feature set and tools are implemented in `src/`. Inspect that folder to see how tools
   are registered and how agents are configured.

   ---
   ## Prerequisites
   - Node.js (recommended: 18+)
   - npm
   - API keys for the model providers you intend to use (OpenAI, LMNR project keys, etc.)

   Important: put your secrets in a local `.env` file (the code uses `dotenv`). Do not commit `.env` to
   the repository. If you accidentally commit secret keys, rotate them immediately.
   
   ---
   ## Installation
   1. Install dependencies:
      npm install

   2. Create a `.env` in the project root with at least the API keys you need. Example (DO NOT copy/paste
    real keys you find in repos or screenshots):
      OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
      LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY=...

   3. (Optional) Build the project to JavaScript:
      npm run build

   ---
   ## Running the agent
   - Development (TypeScript with watch):
     npm run dev
     This runs `tsx watch --env-file=.env src/index.ts` so you can iterate quickly.

   - Start (one-off run without building):
     npm start

   - Production / built CLI:
     npm run build
     npm install -g 
     agi  # this runs the production build of the agent

   ---
   ## Running evaluations
   There are several npm scripts that run evaluation suites (these use `npx lmnr eval`):
   - npm run eval                # run default evaluation
   - npm run eval:multi-turn     # run multi-turn eval example
   - npm run eval:file-tools     # run file-tools eval script
   - npm run eval:shell-tools    # run shell-tools eval script
   - npm run eval:agent          # run agent multi-turn eval

   Check `evals/` for the TypeScript evaluation files; you can add new eval scripts and wire them into
   package.json as needed.

   ---
   ## How to extend or modify the agent
   - Add new tools: implement the tool in `src/` (suggested `src/tools/`), register it with the agent
   initialization code.
   - Add or adjust agents: update `AGENTS.md` and `src/` to define agent behaviors, prompts, and tool
   access policies.
   - Add tests/evaluations: put new eval files in `evals/` and add an npm script to run them.
   - Build and test locally: use `npm run dev` during development, `npm run build` for production.

   ---
   ## Security and best practices
   - Keep `.env` and other secret-bearing files out of git (this repo's `.gitignore` already excludes
   `.env`).
   - Rotate API keys if you believe they were exposed.
   - Use least-privilege API keys for development when possible.

   ---
   ## Troubleshooting
   - "Missing API key" errors: verify your `.env` contains the expected variables and that you restarted
   the dev server after editing `.env`.
   - Build/type errors: ensure you are using a recent Node.js version and that dependencies are installed
    (`npm install`).

   Contributions are welcome. Typical workflow:
   1. Fork the repo
   2. Create a feature branch
   3. Add/modify code and tests/evals
   4. Run `npm run dev` or `npm run build` to verify changes
   5. Open a PR describing your changes
