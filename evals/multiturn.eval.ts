 * Multi-Turn Agent Evaluation
 *
 * Tests full agent behavior with mocked tools:
 * 1. Fresh task: User's first message, check tools + order + LLM judge
 * 2. Mid-conversation: Pre-filled messages, check continuation behavior
 * 3. Negative: Ensure wrong tool category not used (file vs shell)
 *
 * All tools are mocked to return fixed values for deterministic testing.
 *
 * Evaluators:
 * - toolOrderCorrect: Did tools get called in expected sequence?
 * - toolsAvoided: Were forbidden tools not called?
 * - llmJudge: Does the final response make sense given the task and results?
